This project is designed to enhance our skills in working with APIs, specifically the Reddit API. Through a series of tasks, we will gain hands-on experience in making API calls, handling pagination, parsing JSON responses, and implementing recursive functions.

Background Context
API-related questions are common in interviews, ranging from simple queries to more complex tasks involving recursion and data manipulation. The Reddit API provides an excellent platform for practise due to its numerous endpoints and wealth of information. Developing proficiency in API usage can be advantageous during technical interviews and may also find practical applications in personal projects.
